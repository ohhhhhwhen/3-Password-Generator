## Assignment info
In this assignment, I myself got familiar with creating a javascript file. 
A file separate from the html, which we usually add at the bottom of the
html body. Instead of having one long html file, it will be separated between 
the two. Within the javascript file,the user will click generate password, 
which calls a function. Then there are prompts and confirm messages for the 
user. To pick different criteria for their password. Using arrays, if/else 
conditions, for loops and while loops to analyze the user criteria and create 
a password. The Password will be displayed in the textbox for the user and when
the copy button is clicked. That will call a function to copy the generated password
to the user's clipboard.
